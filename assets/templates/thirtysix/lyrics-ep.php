                <h3>Wait a minute babe</h3>
                <p>
                    Wait a minute babe; wait while I make a call,<br />
                    I am in bad way, and I think that I might fall,<br />
                    The woman I love has left me,<br />
                    and now I&rsquo;ve got nothing, nothing left at all
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well I&rsquo;ve been drinkin&rsquo; whiskey, from the middle of the day,<br />
                    I&rsquo;ve already done two bottles,<br />
                    But these blues won&rsquo;t go away

                </p>
                <p>
                    Wait a minute babe; wait a minute while I make a call,<br />
                    The woman I love has left me,<br />
                    and now I&rsquo;ve got nothing, nothing left at all
                </p>
                <p>
                    I lost my job; I lost my home; I lost my woman;<br />
                    without you I&rsquo;d be alone

                </p>
                <p>
                    Wait a minute babe, wait a minute while I make a call,<br />
                    The woman I love has left me,<br />
                    and I&rsquo;ve got nothing, nothing left at all
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wait a minute babe, wait a minute while I make a call,<br />
                    I&rsquo;m in a bad way and I think that I might fall,<br />
                    The woman I love has left me,<br />
                    and I&rsquo;ve got nothing, nothing left at all

                <h3>Sex is the key</h3>
                <p>
                    Last time I saw you, was the other night,<br />
                    You were lookin&rsquo; so pretty, and your eyes were bright,<br />
                    I knew that I wanted you, there ain&rsquo;t another with your name,<br />
                    I felt that you saw me, and that you felt the same,<br />
                    Well that&rsquo;s all right babe, that&rsquo;s all right by me,<br />
                    ‘Cause love is the answer but sex is the key
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I said I love you, the sort of statement I&rsquo;d sing,<br />
                    It&rsquo;s just to persuade you, to do the wild thing,<br />
                    ‘Cause love is enduring, sometimes it&rsquo;s so rare,<br />
                    It&rsquo;s not the dancing that&rsquo;s done on the easy chair,<br />
                    Well that&rsquo;s all right honey, that&rsquo;s all right by me,<br />
                    ‘Cause love is the answer, but sex is the key…

                <h3>I&rsquo;m in love with you</h3>
                <p>
                    When I met you babe, an auspicious affair,<br />
                    Right where you wanted me, leaning back in the chair,<br />
                    You said no; I didn&rsquo;t know what that meant,<br />
                    Then my Ma marooned you, at that rockin&rsquo; event
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all these years,<br />
                    After all we&rsquo;ve been through,<br />
                    Our hearts still together,<br />
                    I&rsquo;m in love with you
                </p>
                <p>
                    32 years, we&rsquo;ve been hangin&rsquo; around,<br />
                    I know sometimes, you don&rsquo;t like what you found,<br />
                    But we&rsquo;re still together, almost never apart,<br />
                    You&rsquo;re the only one, with who I share my heart
                </p>
                <p>
                    You know what to say, when things go wrong,<br />
                    You know what to do, to keep us all together    
                <p>
                </p>
                    Two fine children, now grown into men,<br />
                    I thought they&rsquo;d left home, never see them again,<br />
                    I was so wrong babe, they come back regularly,<br />
                    The benefit of a loving home; quintessentially.

                <h3>You don't have to (take this shit)</h3>
                <p>
                    You don’t have to take this shit,<br />
                    Pass it back to those responsible for it,<br />
                    Make them see that you can think,<br />
                    Shove it up their ass so they create the stink
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whatever happened to peace of mind,<br />
                    Whatever happened to reality,<br />
                    Whatever happened to peace of mind,<br />
                    Whatever happened to you?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was once a bit like you,<br />
                    Respecting others when really no respect was due,<br />
                    Now I have learnt to deal with fools,<br />
                    There is more to life than sticking to the rules
                </p>
                <p>
                    Living then was no easy road,<br />
                    Reading from the book it programs you with code,<br />
                    Give them back their bloody tome,<br />
                    Your friends and family love you back at home
