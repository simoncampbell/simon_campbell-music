                <h3>I like it like that</h3>
                <p>
                    A golden dream, a child so fair,<br>
                    A fine wine drank in my favourite chair,<br>
                    A love for life – a love for truth,<br>
                    A signal back to my frantic youth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got the power, I got the speed,<br>
                    I got every little thing I need,<br>
                    Life is for real, no second chance,<br>
                    I take it all, I take my stance,<br>
                    So I don’t care if you don’t know where I’m at,<br>
                    ’Cause babe I like it like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A thousand wishes, a thousand dreams,<br>
                    A thousand lives, a thousand schemes,<br>
                    A thousand ways to show my affection,<br>
                    All leading in the same direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Five hundred years of war and peace,<br>
                    I see it all but have no release,<br>
                    Five hundred victims, five hundred screams,<br>
                    I hear them nightly in my dreams&hellip;

                <h3>Preacher (of love)</h3>
                <p>
                    I’ve got to prove that my intentions are good
                    I’m a living legend but I don’t carve in wood
                    I shut the pitstops called reality
                    I am so blind; that I cannot see
                    Listen to me now who am I? I’m the preacher man
                </p>
                <p>
                    I look quite young of that I’m always told
                    I know the points without even being told
                    that limitations are a fact of life
                    an indiscretion with another mans wife
                    Listen to me now who am I? I’m the preacher man yeah
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m the Preacher, the Preacher of love
                    I’m the Preacher, sent from God above
                    and if you show me your sin,
                    you come right on in kneel before, the Preacher of love
                </p>
                <p>
                    My caring wife it’s everything that we share
                    My loving flock made me a millionaire
                    We say the words but they don’t mean much
                    My famous lifestyle keeps me nicely out of touch
                    Listen to me now who am I? I’m the preacher man
                <p>

                <h3>Misgivings</h3>
                <p>
                    Leavin’ home for the first time, must have been a quarter past ten
                    The sun still kept shinin’, before the rain moved in
                    It was late in September, just before the fall
                    My mom had packed me a suitcase, and left it out in the hall
                    I didn’t know what was coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Got the car all started and turned the radio on
                    Bob Dylan was singin’ something about Maggie’s farm
                    I pulled out of the driveway straight into the oncoming car
                    That’s when I met you babe; I didn’t get very far
                    I didn’t know what was coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                We were rockin’ and rollin’ all over the place
                Standin’ around with that look on your face
                It started in Blacko and ended in love
                Still, I have had my misgivings&hellip;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since that day that I met you life has been a turbulent thing
                    Its gone straight from my moms place into a relationship thing
                    Every day is a circus I really give you credit for that
                    Complimentary they call us but I’m not sure about that
                </p>
