                <h3>I like it like that</h3>
                <p>
                    A golden dream, a child so fair,<br />
                    A fine wine drank in my favourite chair,<br />
                    A love for life &ndash; a love for truth,<br />
                    A signal back to my frantic youth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got the power, I got the speed,<br />
                    I got every little thing I need,<br />
                    Life is for real, no second chance,<br />
                    I take it all, I take my stance,<br />
                    So I don&rsquo;t care if you don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m at,<br />
                    &rsquo;Cause babe I like it like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A thousand wishes, a thousand dreams,<br />
                    A thousand lives, a thousand schemes,<br />
                    A thousand ways to show my affection,<br />
                    All leading in the same direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Five hundred years of war and peace,<br />
                    I see it all but have no release,<br />
                    Five hundred victims, five hundred screams,<br />
                    I hear them nightly in my dreams&hellip;

                    You would need another life to do the things I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; to do<br />

                </p>
                <p>
                    Tell your momma I&rsquo;m a comin&rsquo;<br />
                    Goin&rsquo; to steal your heart away<br />
                    You can fill a million novels with the things I&rsquo;m goin to say<br />
                    Got you round my little finger<br />
                    Got you caught up in my spell<br />
                    Goin&rsquo; to burn your pretty fingers babe<br />
                    I&rsquo;m as hot as hell.

                    You don&rsquo;t even know my name<br />
                    Goin&rsquo; a hawkin&rsquo; and a talkin&rsquo;<br />
                    Ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; left to sell, oh no<br />

                    Because the only thing that matters babe,<br />
                    Is that you love me, and I love you,<br />

                    you talk to me like a lover so true,<br />

                    And see this friend we both knew,<br />
                    I read your mind, I could tell in my heart,<br />

                    To believe in nothing, nothing but a song,<br />
                    Deep in your heart, You know that it&rsquo;s true,<br />

                    How I berated you, and your brother [family] too,<br />
                    I know it&rsquo;s hard, to tell you all of this,<br />
                    But I still love you, and that&rsquo;s all I have left&hellip;

                    My mind is injured, your body&rsquo;s bruised,<br />
                    Your trust and honesty, I&rsquo;ve blatantly abused,<br />
                    When I saw you in the station, when I saw you in the rain,<br />
                    It cuts me up again

                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve got to prove that my intentions are good<br />
                    I&rsquo;m a living legend but I don&rsquo;t carve in wood<br />
                    I shut the pitstops called reality<br />
                    I am so blind; that I cannot see<br />
                    Listen to me now who am I? I&rsquo;m the preacher man
                </p>
                <p>
                    I look quite young of that I&rsquo;m always told<br />
                    I know the points without even being told<br />
                    that limitations are a fact of life<br />
                    an indiscretion with another mans wife<br />
                    Listen to me now who am I? I&rsquo;m the preacher man yeah
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m the Preacher, the Preacher of love<br />
                    I&rsquo;m the Preacher, sent from God above<br />
                    and if you show me your sin,<br />
                    you come right on in kneel before, the Preacher of love

                <p>
                    My caring wife it&rsquo;s everything that we share<br />
                    My loving flock made me a millionaire<br />
                    We say the words but they don&rsquo;t mean much<br />
                    My famous lifestyle keeps me nicely out of touch<br />

                <p>
                    Leavin&rsquo; home for the first time, must have been a quarter past ten<br />
                    The sun still kept shinin&rsquo;, before the rain moved in<br />
                    It was late in September, just before the fall<br />
                    My mom had packed me a suitcase, and left it out in the hall<br />
                    I didn&rsquo;t know what was coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Got the car all started and turned the radio on<br />
                    Bob Dylan was singin&rsquo; something about Maggie&rsquo;s farm<br />
                    I pulled out of the driveway straight into the oncoming car<br />
                    That&rsquo;s when I met you babe; I didn&rsquo;t get very far<br />
                    I didn&rsquo;t know what was coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were rockin&rsquo; and rollin&rsquo; all over the place<br />
                    Standin&rsquo; around with that look on your face<br />
                    It started in Blacko and ended in love<br />
                    Still, I have had my misgivings&hellip;<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since that day that I met you life has been a turbulent thing<br />
                    Its gone straight from my moms place into a relationship thing<br />
                    Every day is a circus I really give you credit for that<br />
                    Complimentary they call us but I&rsquo;m not sure about that<br />

                    You know I love you brother and that&rsquo;s the truth,<br />
                    Enigmatic is what they say,<br />

                    Leave it alone, keep them at bay,<br />

                    Give us a rest, give us a break,<br />

                    there&rsquo;s a thousand miles between me and you,<br />
                    Like brothers in arms the battle is there,<br />
                    The odds are large but it is never fair

                    It&rsquo;s been happening ever since that we met,<br />
                    I don&rsquo;t believe in all the things that are said,<br />
                    The road is long and we struggle until,<br />
