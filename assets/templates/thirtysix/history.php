            <h3>The journey</h3>
            <p>
                Well this is it, Simon&rsquo;s first solo album in thirty six years of spanking the plank. It&rsquo;s not blues, it&rsquo;s not rock, it&rsquo;s not folk; it is an eclectic mix that will take you on his very personal musical journey. Each song is written about real people, with real lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                His whole band and engineering team have taken a lot of time and effort to make this sound as good as he can, using truly beautiful equipment and techniques. So, it wont be as loud as some of the CD&rsquo;s you buy: it&rsquo;s not compressed into oblivion. It contains a lot of detail and spacial imaging, so sit down with a large glass of whatever it is that makes you smile and turn it on. Dance if you feel like it, cry if you need too.
            </p>
            <p>
                ThirtySix is an honest album and has many imperfections, but it is Simon Campbell, right now. We hope you enjoy it.

            <h3>Studio team</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Steve Boyce-Buckley has been a delight to work with as he understands how to record properly, not samples, but real instruments, using the magnificent console and real outboard. He has an empathy with the artist, which is very rare indeed. As co-producer, brass and backing vocal arranger, he has added many wonderful elements to the album. He has helped me create a very honest snapshot of me and my songs.</p>
                <p>The studio&rsquo;s &lsquo;digital&rsquo; assistants, Viktor Sigurj&oacute;nsson and Chris Taylor are delightful and engaging young men. Nothing was too much trouble. Beer, tea with Manuka honey, many trips to the mighty Co-Op.</p>
                <p>The studio manager, Martin Rhodes gave a calm air to proceedings and managed to extract me from the pooh on numerous occasions. Never over-fussing, but there when needed.</p>
                <p>Phil (maintenance man and lawnmaster) was lovely, creating a beautiful environment for us all to work.</p>
                <p>Finally, a sincere thanks to Ian Devaney and Lisa Stansfield for building and maintaining this unique, world class facility.</p>
