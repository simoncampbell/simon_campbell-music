HOW TO SETUP
============

1. Create a database and import the .sql file found in /setup/
2. Rename config.local.sample.php to config.local.php
3. Add the database settings to config.local.php
4. Update the $conf['site_url'] setting in config.local.php (this will depend on how you setup your virtual host)
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the dev and live environments
6. CHMOD 777 the directories, /uploads, /manage/cache, and /assets/templates
7. Make sure config.php is not writeable or it's contents will get overwritten.

Special cases:
----------------------

* Arnold (dev server) is set up strangely to you may need to change this line in your config file:

$conf['document_root'] = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];

To actually hold a hardcoded server path. i.e. $conf['document_root'] = '/var/www/html/subdomains/etc/etc/public'
